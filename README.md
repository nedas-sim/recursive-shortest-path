# recursive-shortest-path

Program finds the most optimal solution to a given problem:

A tiled map is given where:

- . - dot represents a walkable path
- D - starting position for one of the friends
- S - position where friends can meet
- P - position for pizzeria
- X - unwalkable tile

Friends need to meet in one of the meeting locations and then they go to one of the pizzerias together.
After that they go back to the meeting location and the each goes straight home.

The program finds the most optimal route for meeting place and pizzeria combos.

Program uses custom made algorithm that uses recursion to give the shortest path's length between given tiles.
